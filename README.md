# Obsidian-Utils

## Reason for development
The main goal for me developing this is to help content creators when working on coding tutorials or when there is a need to animate text being typed into the markdown editior.

## Features I plan to implement
- Typewriter Effect
  - Full Document
  - Specified blocks of code (w/delimiter or something)
  - Add incremental support (do one at a time)
  - Variable type back speed (maybe make it a bit randomized to appear more realistic)
- Hide sensitive data
  - Auto jumble text (maybe scramble text in Preview mode but not in editing mode)
  - blur text
  - hide text
